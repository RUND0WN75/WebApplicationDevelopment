                LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION FOR CRAIG WALKUP
                <br><br>
                It is my pleasure to recommend Craig Walkup for a position related to computer science and information technology. I have been Craig’s English teacher since August 2016 when he enrolled in the Web Application Development lab at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART). 
                <br><br>
                Craig will make an excellent employee due to is his strong work ethic and positive attitude.  I have the pleasure of working with Craig for three hours each day. He is always on-task, working cooperatively with others. When he needs help, he is not afraid to ask the instructors and others students for assistance. He is punctual and has excellent attendance. He has maintained an overall 3.3 grade point average in high school.
                <br><br>
                Next, Craig has learned a great deal about website development in the short time school has been in session. He has created several websites already using html, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition, he has learned how to use wireframes to plan websites and Brackets to enhance his final products. The focus of these websites include a country of choice, an endangered species, and a personal website to showcase his professional portfolio, technology skills, and writing abilities. Soon, he will work with a team and a business owner to develop a website for a real-world company. Furthermore, he knows how to use Microsoft Office and Adobe programs.
                <br><br>
                Although I have only known Craig for several months, I highly recommend him for an IT position. He works hard and willingly collaborates with others. He completes all of his assignments on time and is a pleasure to have in class. He is mature, respectful, and dependable. He communicates very effectively with his peers and teachers.
